# Calculator
Final project on The Odin Project's Foundations course.

The culmination of the foundations course, I created this project to work on HTML, CSS styling and JS DOM management. The main goal was to practice integrating all of this together in a single project.

## Challenges

#### operate() Function
The actual logic for the sums was simple, and it was only when designing the operator function that I encountered my first real issues. The operate() function itself takes in two numbers and an operator function. It then serves to apply the operator function given as an argument on the two number arguments. 

I found the use of flags very helpful during this process, as it allowed me to check the state of variables modified in other functions. This was necessary when keeping track of the operators that had been pressed, as additional operators pressed after the first had to be ignored, but not if the first operator had been removed by the erase button.
